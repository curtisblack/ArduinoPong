# Arduino Pong
This is the Arduino version of Pong.
The lights bounce from one end to the other and you must press the button in time to get it to bounce back the other way.
If you press the button before the light gets to you, or if you don't press it in time, you will lose the game.
One of the end lights will flash to show the winner.
Press the reset button to start a new game.

You will need 6 LEDs and two push buttons connected to the Arduino. You can also connect a buzzer to play sounds as the light bounces back and forward.
